Preparation

For all ONTAP backends, Trident requires at least one
`aggregate assigned to the SVM`_.

.. _aggregate assigned to the SVM: https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1368404/html/GUID-5255E7D8-F420-4BD3-AEFB-7EF65488C65C.html

Remember that you can also run more than one driver, and create storage
classes that point to one or the other. For example, you could configure a
``san-dev`` class that uses the ``ontap-san`` driver and a ``san-default`` class that
uses the ``ontap-san-economy`` one.

All of your Kubernetes worker nodes must have the appropriate iSCSI tools
installed. See the :ref:`worker configuration guide <iSCSI>` for more details.

.. _ontap-san-authentication:

Authentication
--------------

Trident offers two modes of authenticating an ONTAP backend.

- **Credential-based**: The username and password to an ONTAP user with the
  required :ref:`permissions <ontap-san-user-permissions>`. It is recommended
  to use a pre-defined security login role, such as ``admin`` or ``vsadmin`` to
  ensure maximum compatibility with ONTAP versions.
- **Certificate-based**: Trident can also communicate with an ONTAP cluster using
  a certificate installed on the backend. Here, the backend definition must
  contain Base64-encoded values of the client certificate, key, and the trusted
  CA certificate if used (recommended).

Users can also choose to update existing backends, opting to move from
credential-based to certificate-based, and vice-versa. If **both credentials and
certificates are provided**, Trident will default to using certificates while
issuing a warning to remove the credentials from the backend definition.

Credential-based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trident requires the credentials to an SVM-scoped/Cluster-scoped admin to
communicate with the ONTAP backend. It is recommended to make use of standard,
pre-defined roles such as ``admin`` or ``vsadmin``. This ensures forward
compatibility with future ONTAP releases that may expose feature APIs to be used
by future Trident releases. A custom security login role can be created and used
with Trident, but is **not recommended**.

A sample backend definition will look like this:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "version": 1,
    "backendName": "ExampleBackend",
    "storageDriverName": "ontap-san",
    "managementLIF": "10.0.0.1",
    "dataLIF": "10.0.0.2",
    "svm": "svm_nfs",
    "username": "vsadmin",
    "password": "secret",
  }

Keep in mind that the backend definition is the only place the credentials are
stored in plaintext. Once the backend is created, **usernames/passwords are encoded
with Base64 and stored as Kubernetes secrets**. The creation/updation of a backend
is the only step that requires knowledge of the credentials. As such, it is an
admin-only operation, to be performed by the Kubernetes/Storage administrator.

Certificated-based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trident ``21.01`` introduces a new feature: authenticating ONTAP backends using
certificates. New and existing backends can use a certificate and communicate with
the ONTAP backend. Three parameters are required in the backend definition.

- ``clientCertificate``: Base64-encoded value of client certificate.
- ``clientPrivateKey``: Base64-encoded value of associated private key.
- ``trustedCACertificate``: Base64-encoded value of trusted CA certificate. If
  using a trusted CA, this parameter must be provided. This can be ignored if
  no trusted CA is used.

A typical workflow involves the following steps:

1. A client certificate and key are generated. When generating, **CN (Common Name) is
   set to the ONTAP user to authenticate as**.

  .. code-block:: bash

    #Generate certificate used to authenticate the client
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout k8senv.key -out k8senv.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=NC/L=RTP/O=NetApp/CN=admin"

2. Add trusted CA certificate to the ONTAP cluster. This may be already handled by
   the storage administrator. Ignore if no trusted CA is used.

  .. code-block:: bash

    #Install trusted CA cert in ONTAP cluster.
    security certificate install -type server -cert-name <trusted-ca-cert-name> -vserver <vserver-name>
    ssl modify -vserver <vserver-name> -server-enabled true -client-enabled true -common-name <common-name> -serial <SN-from-trusted-CA-cert> -ca <cert-authority>

3. Install the client certificate and key (from step 1) on the ONTAP cluster.

  .. code-block:: bash

    #Install certificate generated from step 1 on ONTAP cluster
    security certificate install -type client-ca -cert-name <certificate-name> -vserver <vserver-name>
    security ssl modify -vserver <vserver-name> -client-enabled true

4. Confirm the ONTAP security login role supports ``cert`` authentication method.

   .. code-block:: bash

     #Add cert authentication method to ONTAP security login role
     security login create -user-or-group-name admin -application ontapi -authentication-method cert
     security login create -user-or-group-name admin -application http -authentication-method cert

5. Test authentication using certificate generated.

   .. code-block:: bash

     #Test access to ONTAP cluster using certificate. Replace <ONTAP Management LIF> and <vserver name> with Management LIF IP and SVM name.
     curl -X POST -Lk https://<ONTAP-Management-LIF>/servlets/netapp.servlets.admin.XMLrequest_filer --key k8senv.key --cert ~/k8senv.pem -d '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><netapp xmlns="http://www.netapp.com/filer/admin" version="1.21" vfiler="<vserver-name>"><vserver-get></vserver-get></netapp>'

6. Encode certificate, key and trusted CA certificate with Base64.

   .. code-block:: bash

     #Encode with Base64 and write each key to a file.
     base64 -w 0 k8senv.pem >> cert_base64
     base64 -w 0 k8senv.key >> key_base64
     base64 -w 0 trustedca.pem >> trustedca_base64

7. Create backend using the values obtained from step 6.

   .. code-block:: bash

     #Trident backend using cert-based auth
     $ cat cert-backend.json
     {
     "version": 1,
     "storageDriverName": "ontap-san",
     "backendName": "SanBackend",
     "managementLIF": "1.2.3.4",
     "dataLIF": "1.2.3.8",
     "svm": "vserver_test",
     "clientCertificate": "Faaaakkkkeeee...Vaaalllluuuueeee",
     "clientPrivateKey": "LS0tFaKE...0VaLuES0tLS0K",
     "trustedCACertificate": "QNFinfO...SiqOyN",
     "storagePrefix": "myPrefix_"
     }

     #Create backend
     $ tridentctl create backend -f cert-backend.json -n trident
     +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
     |    NAME    | STORAGE DRIVER |                 UUID                 | STATE  | VOLUMES |
     +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
     | SanBackend | ontap-san      | 586b1cd5-8cf8-428d-a76c-2872713612c1 | online |       0 |
     +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+

Updating Authentication Methods/Rotating Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can update an existing backend to make use of a different authentication
method or to rotate their credentials. This works both ways: backends that make
use of username/password can be updated to use certificates; backends that
utilize certificates can be updated to username/password based. To do this,
an updated backend.json file containing the required parameters must be used to
execute ``tridentctl backend update``.

.. note::

  When rotating passwords, the storage administrator must first update the
  password for the user on ONTAP. This is followed by a backend update. When
  rotating certificates, multiple certificates can be added to the user. The
  backend is then updated to use the new certificate, following which the old
  certificate can be deleted from the ONTAP cluster.

.. code-block:: bash

  #Update backend.json to include chosen auth method
  $ cat cert-backend-updated.json
  {
  "version": 1,
  "storageDriverName": "ontap-san",
  "backendName": "SanBackend",
  "managementLIF": "1.2.3.4",
  "dataLIF": "1.2.3.8",
  "svm": "vserver_test",
  "username": "vsadmin",
  "password": "secret",
  "storagePrefix": "myPrefix_"
  }

  #Update backend with tridentctl
  $ tridentctl update backend SanBackend -f cert-backend-updated.json -n trident
  +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
  |    NAME    | STORAGE DRIVER |                 UUID                 | STATE  | VOLUMES |
  +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+
  | SanBackend | ontap-san      | 586b1cd5-8cf8-428d-a76c-2872713612c1 | online |       9 |
  +------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+

Updating a backend does not disrupt access to volumes that have already been
created, nor impact volume connections made after. A successful backend update
indicates that Trident can communicate with the ONTAP backend and handle future
volume operations.

.. _igroup-management:

igroup Management
-----------------

Trident uses `igroups`_ to control access to the volumes (LUNs) that it
provisions. Trident administrators have two options when it comes to specifying
igroups for backends:

* Trident can automatically create and manage an igroup per backend. If
  ``igroupName`` is not included in the backend definition, Trident creates an
  igroup named ``trident-<backend-UUID>`` on the SVM. This will ensure each
  backend has a dedicated igroup and handle the automated addition/deletion of
  Kubernetes node IQNs.
* Alternatively, pre-created igroups can also be provided in a backend definition.
  This can be done using the ``igroupName`` config parameter. Trident will
  add/delete Kubernetes node IQNs to the pre-existing igroup.

For backends that have ``igroupName`` defined, the ``igroupName`` can be deleted
with a ``tridentctl backend update`` to have Trident auto-handle igroups. This
will not disrupt access to volumes that are already attached to workloads. Future
connections will be handled using the igroup Trident created.

.. _igroups: https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196995/html/GUID-CF01DCCD-2C24-4519-A23B-7FEF55A0D9A3.html

.. important::

   Dedicating an igroup for each unique instance of Trident is a best practice
   that is beneficial for the Kubernetes admin as well as the storage admin. CSI
   Trident automates the addition and removal of cluster node IQNs to the igroup,
   greatly simplifying its management. When using the same SVM across Kubernetes
   environments (and Trident installs), using a dedicated igroup ensures that
   changes made to one Kubernetes cluster don't influence igroups associated with
   another.

   In addition, it is also important to ensure each node in the Kubernetes cluster
   has a unique IQN. As mentioned above, Trident automatically handles the addition
   and removal of IQNs. Reusing IQNs across hosts can lead to undesirable scenarios
   where hosts get mistaken for one another and access to LUNs is denied.

If Trident is configured to function as a CSI Provisioner, Kubernetes node IQNs
are automatically added to/removed from the igroup. When nodes are added to a
Kubernetes cluster, ``trident-csi`` DaemonSet deploys a pod (``trident-csi-xxxxx``)
on the newly added nodes and registers the new nodes it can attach volumes to.
Node IQNs are also added to the backend's igroup. A similar set of steps handle
the removal of IQNs when node(s) are cordoned, drained, and deleted from Kubernetes.

If Trident does not run as a CSI Provisioner, the igroup must be manually updated
to contain the iSCSI IQNs from every worker node in the Kubernetes cluster. IQNs
of nodes that join the Kubernetes cluster will need to be added to the igroup.
Similarly, IQNs of nodes that are removed from the Kubernetes cluster must be
removed from the igroup.

Authenticating Connections with Bidirectional CHAP
--------------------------------------------------

Trident can authenticate iSCSI sessions with bidirectional CHAP beginning with 20.04
for the ``ontap-san`` and ``ontap-san-economy`` drivers. This requires enabling the
``useCHAP`` option in your backend definition. When set to ``true``, Trident
configures the SVM's default initiator security to bidirectional CHAP and set
the username and secrets from the backend file. To get started, visit the
:ref:`Bidirectional CHAP Config Guide <ontap-bidir-chap>`.
