**Beta Features:**

**Deprecations:**

## v20.10.0

- **IMPORTANT**: If you are upgrading from Trident 19.07 or 19.10 please carefully read [this](https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v20.07/kubernetes/upgrades/index.html).
- **IMPORTANT** Trident relies on the [trident-autosupport](https://hub.docker.com/r/netapp/trident-autosupport) sidecar container to periodically send usage and support telemetry data to NetApp by default. Usage of the trident-autosupport project falls under the [NetApp EULA](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/enduser-license-agreement-worldwide.pdf). Automatic sending of this data can be disabled at Trident install time via the "--silence-autosupport" flag.

  (Issue [#93](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/93)).
- **Kubernetes:** Added the ability to rename an existing backend.
- **Kubernetes:** SolidFire defaults to use CHAP if Kubernetes version is >= 1.7
  and a `trident` access group doesn't exist. Setting AccessGroup or UseCHAP in
  config overrides this behavior.

**Enhancements:**
- Trident can now serve as a Docker Volume Plugin.
- Enabled cloning volumes via a new PVC annotation.
- Added support for Kubernetes 1.8 Storage Classes to set the mount options and reclaim policy of PVs (Issue [#49](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/49)).

- Trident installs correctly in a Kubernetes pod with E-series and ONTAP
  SAN.
- Trident allows periods in PVC names (Issue [#40](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/40)).
- Fixed issue where ONTAP NAS volumes were not mountable immediately
  after creation when using load-sharing mirrors for the SVM root
  volume (Issue [#44](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/44)).
- File system type is not set for NFS volumes in the persistent store
  (Issue [#57](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/57)).
- Deprecated the update script.

**Enhancements:**
- Controller serial numbers are reported by the REST interface and
  tridentctl.
- tridentctl logs can display launcher and ephemeral logs, and it can
  create a support archive.
- Added ontap-nas-economy driver (Issue [#2](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/2)).
- Added support for NetApp Volume Encryption to the ONTAP drivers
  (Issue [#3](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/3)).
- Trident installer now works with Kubernetes 1.8.
- tridentctl can detect and use 'oc' in OpenShift environments.

## v17.07.0

**Fixes:**
- Trident and Trident launcher no longer fail if they cannot validate
  the container orchestrator version.
- When running in a pod, the Trident REST interface is no longer
  accessible by default from outside the pod.
- Trident correctly handles updating backends that have volumes
  provisioned using storage classes that no longer exist (Issue [#29](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/29)).
- Installer script correctly creates a new namespace (Issue [#39](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/39)).

**Enhancements:**
- Added support for `storage.k8s.io/v1` storage classes and the default
  storage class introduced in Kubernetes v1.6.0.
- Changed the installer script to support both Kubernetes and OpenShift
  deployments in a uniform manner and to leverage Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC) authorization for better security.
- Added scripts for uninstalling and updating Trident.
- Added tridentctl CLI tool for managing Trident.
- SolidFire backend configuration file accepts up to four Volume Access
  Group IDs (Issue [#24](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/24)).
- Improved efficiency of ONTAP LUN ID selection.
- Added PVC annotation `trident.netapp.io/blockSize` to specify
  block/sector size for SolidFire backends (Issues [#33](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/33)
  and [#37](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/37)).
- Added PVC annotation `trident.netapp.io/fileSystem` to specify the
  file system type for iSCSI volumes (Issue [#37](https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/37)).


## v17.04.0

**Fixes:**

- Trident now rejects ONTAP backends with no aggregates assigned to the
  SVM.
- Trident now allows ONTAP backends even if it cannot read the aggregate
  media type, or if the media type is unknown. However, such backends
  will be ignored for storage classes that require a specific media
  type.
- Trident launcher supports creating the ConfigMap in a non-default
  namespace.

**Enhancements:**

- The improved Trident launcher has a better support for failure
  recovery, error reporting, user arguments, and unit testing.
- Enabled SVM-scoped users for ONTAP backends.
- Switched to using vserver-show-aggr-get-iter API for ONTAP 9.0 and
  later to get aggregate media type.
- Added support for E-Series.
- Upgraded the etcd version to v3.1.3.
- Added release notes (CHANGELOG.md).

## v1.0

- Trident v1.0 provides storage orchestration for Kubernetes, acting as
  an external provisioner for NetApp ONTAP and SolidFire systems.
- Through its REST interface, Trident can provide storage orchestration
  for non-Kubernetes deployments.
